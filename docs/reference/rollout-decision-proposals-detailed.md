# Rollout Decision Proposals - Detailed Rationale

These are proposed decisions for the remaining open items, with full rationale and detailed procedures.

They are written as defaults the team can confirm or amend. They should not be treated as formally agreed until the relevant release/process owners confirm them.

Confirmation status, accountable owner gaps and evidence requirements are tracked in the [release decision register](../release-decision-register.md).

## 1. `development` To `main`

Proposed decision:

```text
Adopt `main` as the production/live baseline branch.
Treat the current `development` model as transitional until the release automation pilot is ready.
```

### Technical Cutover Steps

The transition means:

1. `master` currently represents production/live (even if drift has occurred).
2. After the agreed cutover release, `master` is renamed to `main` (or a new `main` is created from the confirmed production state).
3. `development` is not renamed to `main`. Instead, `main` starts from the confirmed production release state.
4. `development` is frozen and eventually archived/deleted after confirming no open work depends on it.
5. Existing `master` is archived or deleted after `main` is confirmed.

This is not a rename of `development` to `main`. It is a fresh start where `main` represents the actual production release state at cutover time.

Suggested rollout:

1. Confirm the cutover release.
2. Freeze new process changes on `development`.
3. Create `main` from the confirmed production release state (or rename `master` to `main`).
4. Confirm branch protections on `main`.
5. Update automation, documentation and team guidance to use `main`.
6. Archive `development` and old `master` after transition is stable.

Minimum confirmation needed:

- Release/process owner confirmation.
- Repo owner confirmation.
- Automation owner confirmation that Drone jobs target the right branch.

## 2. Keeping `main` Aligned With Production

Proposed decision:

```text
`main` should represent production/live state.
No release is closed until the released state has been reconciled back to `main`.
```

Suggested rule:

1. Release branch is deployed to production.
2. Production smoke/technical validation passes.
3. QAT/release approval is recorded where required.
4. Release branch is merged into `main`.
5. Release report links are attached to the release record.
6. Any active future release branches receive required forward merges.

Closure checklist:

- `main` contains the production release state.
- Release tag/report is available.
- Manifest/chart state matches production.
- Required forward merges are complete or explicitly tracked.

## 3. Release Branch Creation

Proposed decision:

```text
Create release branches automatically at the start of each sprint/release for every in-scope repository that needs one.
Default source branch is `main`.
```

Suggested naming:

```text
release/<major.minor>
```

Example:

```text
release/5.14
```

Exception:

```text
If releases need to be chained, explicitly configure the release branch source instead of silently using another branch.
```

## 4. Multiple Active Release Branches

Proposed decision:

```text
Any fix merged into an earlier active release should be assessed for forward-merge into later active release branches.
```

Suggested rule:

- If a hotfix goes into `release/5.14`, check whether `release/5.15` also needs it.
- If a delayed feature branch continues across releases, the feature owner should regularly merge in the relevant active release branch.
- Before opening or updating an MR, the feature owner should merge the current target release branch into the feature branch to expose conflicts early.
- Release closure should include a forward-merge check.

Suggested owner:

- Feature owner for feature branches.
- Release owner for release-to-release forward-merge tracking.

## 5. Changed-Chart Deployment Override

Proposed decision:

```text
Deploy all changed charts by default.
Allow exclusions only with explicit release owner confirmation and an audit note.
```

Override should record:

- Chart/service excluded.
- Reason for exclusion.
- Approver.
- Impact/risk.
- Follow-up action or release where it will be included.

Suggested default:

```text
If the chart changed and there is no confirmed exclusion, deploy it.
```

## 6. Quality Gates And Human Approval

Proposed decision:

```text
Automation can prepare release artefacts and reports, but higher-environment promotion and production release still require human approval.
```

Suggested gates:

| Stage | Gate |
| --- | --- |
| Branch commit | Build/test/scan succeeds before chart update. |
| Chart update | Image and Helm chart are built/uploaded before Cerberus chart update runs. |
| Shared dev deploy | Pipeline green, chart update complete, report generated. |
| SIT / higher environment | Release owner reviews report and changed charts. |
| Production | QAT/release approval, rollback/fix-forward plan, final report check. |

Suggested fail-fast items:

- Image build failure.
- Helm chart upload failure.
- Tag generation failure.
- Cerberus chart update failure.
- Missing or invalid release report.
- Manifest/tag mismatch.

## 7. Failure Handling And Rerun Procedure

Proposed decision:

```text
The final Git/chart/reporting step should be idempotent and safe to rerun after transient failures.
```

Suggested rerun procedure:

1. Identify the failed step.
2. Confirm image and Helm artefact were built/uploaded successfully.
3. Confirm no manual conflicting chart update was made.
4. Rerun the failed automation step.
5. Confirm tags, build numbers, chart branch updates and report output.
6. Record the rerun in the release notes or pipeline audit trail.

Manual intervention rule:

```text
Manual chart edits should be avoided.
If required, they must be recorded in the release report or release notes.
```

## 8. Alerting

Proposed decision:

```text
Add Slack/email alerting for failed automation steps before the process is treated as production-ready.
```

Alert should include:

- Repository/service.
- Branch.
- Release version.
- Failed step.
- Whether rerun is safe.
- Link to failed Drone job.
- Suggested owner/action.

Suggested channels:

- Release channel for release branch failures.
- Squad/team channel for feature branch failures.
- Email only for production or higher-environment release failures, if required by the wider process.

## 9. Shared Dev Environment Rollout

Proposed decision:

```text
Roll out shared dev deployment in phases.
Keep squad dev test environments separate.
```

Suggested phases:

1. Manual trigger: deploy active release branch to shared dev on demand.
2. Scheduled trigger: deploy active release branch to shared dev on a regular cadence.
3. Event trigger: deploy to shared dev after successful merge into the active release branch.
4. Metrics/reporting: add automated integration, performance and health reporting when available.

Out of scope for now:

```text
Ephemeral branch environments.
```

Reason:

```text
ACP support for ephemeral branch environments is uncertain, and the current direction is to use squad dev test environments plus a shared dev integration environment.
```

## 10. Release Report Location And Retention

Proposed decision:

```text
Store release reports as pipeline artefacts and attach/link them from the release record.
```

Suggested retention:

- Keep reports at least through production release, post-release validation and any incident review window.
- Prefer keeping release reports with the release record permanently if storage is cheap and access-controlled.

## 11. Rollback Reconciliation

Proposed decision:

```text
Rollback is an operational path that must leave source control, manifests and release records in a consistent state.
```

### After A Rollback

| Item | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | Should still reflect production state. If rollback reverts production to an earlier release, `main` should be updated to match that state (revert commit or reset to earlier release tag). |
| Manifest | Revert manifest to the version that matches the rolled-back production state. |
| Failed release branch | Keep open for investigation. Close only after the fix-forward or abandonment decision is made. |
| Active future release branches | Forward-merge the rollback state if they depended on the failed release. |
| Release report/notes | Record the rollback event, reason, who decided and what was rolled back. |
| JIRA tickets | Update ticket status to reflect that the release was rolled back. |

### Rollback vs Fix-Forward Decision Guide

| Factor | Prefer Rollback | Prefer Fix-Forward |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User impact severity | High / data risk | Low / cosmetic |
| Fix complexity | Unknown or high | Simple and well-understood |
| Time to fix | Hours or unknown | Minutes |
| Database changes involved | No / reversible | Irreversible DB changes already applied |
| Confidence in rollback | High (tested, no data impact) | Low (untested, data risk) |

### Database/Liquibase Rollback

```text
Database rollback requires special handling because Liquibase changes may be forward-only.
```

Rules:

- If the release included Liquibase changes that have already been applied, assess whether a rollback script exists.
- If no rollback script exists and the DB change is not destructive, fix-forward may be the only safe option.
- If the DB change is destructive or causes data corruption, the incident process takes over.
- Liquibase rollback scripts should be written proactively for any release that includes schema changes to production.

Suggested practice:

```text
Every production Liquibase changeset should have a corresponding rollback block or a documented reason why rollback is not possible.
```

## 12. Tag Jump Checker Future

Proposed decision:

```text
Retire the tag jump checker in its current form once the new release branch model is active.
Replace its validation responsibilities with the new manifest/tag validation rules built into the release automation pipeline.
```

Rationale:

- The tag jump checker assumes linear version/tag ordering, which does not hold in the proposed non-linear release branch model.
- Its core responsibilities (detecting missing tags, wrong tags, blocked tickets, do-not-deploy cases) are being absorbed into the new automation validation rules.
- Rollback version comparisons in the old script are awkward because it prefers higher versions.

Suggested transition:

1. Keep the tag jump checker active during the transition period alongside the new validation.
2. Once the new automation validation is confirmed green for two consecutive releases, retire the tag jump checker.
3. Archive the script for reference but avoid maintaining it.
4. Ensure the new validation covers: wrong tag, missing tag, manifest/tag mismatch, invalid ticket status, do-not-deploy markers and `NA` entries.

## Confirmation Checklist

1. `main` creation from confirmed production baseline.
2. `main` branch protection and production reconciliation rule.
3. Release branch naming.

8. Rerun/manual intervention procedure.
9. Alerting channels and owners.
10. Shared dev rollout phase.
11. New environment readiness checklist.
12. Auto manifest/tag validation strictness.
13. Rollback reconciliation procedure.
14. Tag jump checker retirement plan.
