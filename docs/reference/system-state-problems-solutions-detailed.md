# System State, Problems, Solution Options And Risks - Detailed Analysis

This page contains the detailed analysis behind the shorter current-understanding summary.

Use this page when you need the rationale, operational detail and experience-based notes. Use [system state, problems, solution options and risks](../system-state-problems-solutions.md) for the short version.

## Purpose

This analysis answers four questions:

1. What is the current state of the CI/CD, branching, release and deployment system?
2. What are the main problems?
3. What solution options are available?
4. What risks does each solution introduce?

## Detailed Current Understanding Summary

The main issue is not the branch model alone.

The bigger issue is that release state is distributed across several moving parts:

- source branches,
- release tags,
- images and Helm artefacts,
- Cerberus chart branches,
- manifests,
- values files,
- secrets and configuration,
- Liquibase/database changes,
- runbooks,
- JIRA metadata,
- QAT approvals,
- post-release reconciliation.

That means a branch model change cannot, by itself, make releases safe.

Suggested order:

```text
1. Make the current release process visible and auditable.
2. Move repeatable release work into Drone.
3. Enforce strict tag, manifest and ticket validation.
4. Name owners for release, hotfix, rollback, environment readiness and alerting.
5. Cut over to `main = production` only after the pilot is proven.
6. Consider trunk-based development later, after feature flags and rollback maturity improve.
```

## 1. Current System State

### 1.1 Branching And Release Model

The current branching model is close to GitFlow:

```text
feature branch -> development -> release branch -> master / production
```

Current understanding:

- Feature or ticket branches are used for individual changes.
- Completed work is merged into `development`.
- Release branches are cut from `development`.
- `master` is expected to represent production/live state.
- Release branches are tagged to trigger releasable artefact creation.
- After release, the release branch should be reconciled back into `master` and `development`.

Target direction:

```text
main = production/live baseline
release branch = sprint/release candidate
feature/hotfix branch = created from the relevant release branch
production release = reconciled back into main
```

Important distinction:

```text
Do not rename `development` to `main`.
Create or rename `main` from the confirmed production state.
```

Experience-based note:

In release-process changes, teams often focus too early on "GitFlow vs trunk-based". The better first question is whether the team can prove exactly what is included in a release, who approved it, which artefact was deployed and how rollback would be handled.

### 1.2 Artefacts, Tags And Deployment

A release branch alone does not produce a deployable artefact. The release tag is the bridge between source state and deployable state.

Tag creation appears to trigger:

- repository clone,
- build/test setup,
- Artifactory login,
- service build,
- Maven install/tests for Spring Boot services,
- vulnerability scanning such as Trivy,
- code quality scanning such as Sonar,
- Helm package, dependency build and artefact upload.

Deployment uses packaged Helm artefacts and environment-specific values files.

Key risk:

```text
If the tag points at the wrong commit, every later step can look correct while still deploying the wrong artefact.
```

Experience-based note:

"The branch is correct" is not enough. Production receives an image, chart, manifest, values, secrets and runbook combination. Release safety depends on that whole combination being consistent.

### 1.3 Manifest, JIRA And Release Metadata

Existing scripts appear to support:

- release ticket creation,
- manifest creation,
- JIRA release-label lookup,
- GitLab tag-field lookup,
- changelog update,
- branch creation,
- commits,
- pushes,
- merge requests.

Open validation questions:

- Should a wrong tag fail or warn?
- Should a missing tag fail or warn?
- Does a `do not deploy` marker always stop release?
- How should `NA` tag entries appear in the release report?
- Can invalid ticket status be overridden?
- Is the tag jump checker retired, replaced or adapted?

Recommended position:

```text
Release-integrity issues should fail fast.
Exceptions should be explicit, approved and recorded.
```

### 1.4 Environment Readiness

Lower environments are more ad hoc. SIT and above rely more heavily on release management and QAT approval.

Environment readiness should include:

- values files,
- environment setup script entries,
- Drone secrets/tokens,
- kube/robot token ownership,
- secret chart entries,
- deployment scope behaviour,
- data shape,
- external integrations,
- network access,
- operational permissions,
- runbook steps.

Experience-based note:

A namespace existing in Kubernetes does not mean the environment is release-ready. Release readiness includes secrets, tokens, values, data, access and operational runbooks.

### 1.5 Secrets, Config, Feature Flags And Liquibase

Secrets:

- Managed secrets scripts and Git-crypt appear to be the current direction.
- Secret keys should remain consistent across environments.
- Secret values differ by environment.
- GPG/Git maintainer onboarding is required.
- Secret exposure during screen sharing or recording may require rotation.

Feature flags:

- Feature activation appears to be mostly deploy-time, through values/config.
- Runtime dynamic feature flags are not clearly documented.
- Enabling or disabling a feature may require redeployment.

Liquibase:

- Database changes are part of release scope.
- One Liquibase update may affect multiple projects.
- Rollback-block expectations are not fully defined.

Experience-based note:

Trunk-based development works best when deployment and release are separated. If flag changes require chart redeployment, the team has moved complexity from branches into deployment/configuration rather than removing it.

### 1.6 Ownership And Approval

The ownership need is correctly identified, but several roles still need named owners:

- release owner,
- rollback decision owner,
- hotfix approver,
- Drone secret/token owner,
- service ownership list,
- environment readiness approver,
- post-release reconciliation owner,
- alert owner.

Experience-based note:

Automation is not an owner. When automation fails, someone must decide whether to rerun, override, stop release, roll back or fix forward.
