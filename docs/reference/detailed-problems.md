# Detailed Problem Analysis (P1–P12)

This page provides full analysis of each problem identified in the assessment.

For solutions, see [detailed solutions](detailed-solutions.md).

## 2. Main Problems

### P1 - The Problem Can Be Misframed As Branching Only

The documents started from branching strategy, but the real system spans tags, artefacts, manifests, charts, config, secrets, environments, QAT, rollback and ownership.

Impact:

- A branch change may move risk rather than reduce it.
- A simpler branch model may expose more ambiguity if validation and ownership are weak.

Root cause:

- Release state is not represented by one system.

Recommendation:

- Treat branching as one part of the release operating model.

### P2 - Release Work Is Too Manual

The current process still includes local scripts and manual chart, tag or deployment steps.

Impact:

- Release preparation can take days.
- Execution varies by person.
- Audit trail is weak.
- Local environment differences affect outcomes.

Root cause:

- Automation exists, but it is not yet the mandatory central path.

Recommendation:

- Move repeatable release tasks into Drone and make pipeline output the audit source.

### P3 - Branch, Tag And Artefact Timing Is Not Strict Enough

Branch lifecycle and artefact lifecycle are different.

Impact:

- Wrong commit can be tagged.
- Wrong image or chart can be produced.
- Manifest state can drift from branch state.

Root cause:

- Tag creation rules and validation gates are not fully formalised.

Recommendation:

- Enforce tag timing, tag ownership and tag-to-commit validation in the release pipeline.

### P4 - Release Scope Is Not Explicit

"All services" needs a precise definition.

Scope may include:

- service repos,
- Helm chart repos,
- deployment-management,
- manifests,
- secrets/config,
- Liquibase/database changes,
- runbooks,
- shared libraries,
- changelog/release metadata.

Impact:

- Automation may include too much, too little or the wrong thing.
- Config, secret or database changes may be missed.

Recommendation:

- Create a repository and change-type scope list before scaling automation.

### P5 - Manifest And Ticket Validation May Be Too Permissive

Validation exists, but fail/warn policy is not fully agreed.

Impact:

- Blocked tickets can enter release.
- Wrong service versions can be promoted.
- Release reports can become misleading.

Recommendation:

```text
Wrong tag -> fail
Missing tag -> fail
Manifest/tag mismatch -> fail
Do-not-deploy marker -> fail unless explicitly overridden
Invalid ticket status -> fail or release-owner override
```

### P6 - Changed-Chart Deployment Needs Proof

Deploying only changed charts is the right direction, but detection must be trusted.

Impact:

- A changed chart can be missed.
- An unchanged chart can be deployed unnecessarily.
- Umbrella-chart blast radius can be misunderstood.

Recommendation:

- Use changed-chart deployment by default only after detection has been reviewed against real releases.
- Keep mass diff review mandatory early in rollout.

### P7 - Hotfix And Rollback Are Not Fully Operationalised

Production hotfix and release-phase hotfix scenarios are identified, but the runbook needs approval.

Impact:

- Production fixes can drift from `main`, release branches and manifests.
- Rollback can leave source control and deployment-management inconsistent.
- Liquibase and config changes can make rollback unsafe.

Recommendation:

- Make hotfix and rollback runbooks production gates.

### P8 - Environment Readiness Is Not A Gate

New environments need values, setup entries, Drone secrets/tokens and token ownership confirmed.

Impact:

- An environment can appear available but fail deployment.
- Pre-prod approval can create false confidence if parity is poor.

Recommendation:

- Create an environment readiness checklist and require it before rollout.

### P9 - Secrets And Config Management Will Become Harder At Scale

Git-crypt and managed secrets scripts are workable, but operationally heavy.

Impact:

- Maintainer onboarding slows down.
- Rotation becomes harder.
- Secret exposure response is more expensive.

Recommendation:

- Keep the current approach short term.
- Evaluate External Secrets Operator, Sealed Secrets or a central secret manager after release automation stabilises.

### P10 - Trunk-Based Development Is Risky Without Runtime Feature Flags

Feature flags appear closer to deploy-time values than dynamic runtime control.

Impact:

- Incomplete work may be harder to isolate.
- Turning a feature off may require redeployment.

Recommendation:

- Move toward trunk-based development only after feature flag, testing, monitoring and rollback maturity improve.

### P11 - Ownership Gaps Can Break The Rollout

Templates exist, but named owners are incomplete.

Impact:

- Failures become slow to resolve.
- Overrides become unclear.
- Rollback decisions are delayed.

Recommendation:

- Use a RACI model with one accountable owner per critical activity.

### P12 - Alerting And Rerun Rules Are Incomplete

Failed final Git/chart/reporting steps can leave partial state.

Impact:

- Artefacts may exist while chart updates or reports are missing.
- Manual edits may conflict with reruns.

Recommendation:

- Define alert content, alert channels, alert owners and safe rerun criteria before production rollout.
